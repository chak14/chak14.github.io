## Machine Learning is tough

So…machine learning is tough, right?
Well maybe, but things worth pursuing should be difficult to achieve anyway. For many people, in the beginning, the learning process could seem overwhelming and discouraging.
I think that the best possible approach should be slow and steady: keep learning something every day, it will add up quickly and you will be surprised to see, looking back, how much you learned.
A good practice is to write a diary, recording what you did/learned every day.
You may be asking “But there are so many resources online, where should someone start from?”.
Well, I think that there could be some differences depending on your background. For example, in my case, coming from applied math, I really didn’t need much of a refresh on all the math stuff related to machine learning. In any case, I think there are some pretty good free resources that anyone approaching the field should look at. I will list them here with a brief description for each of them, I strongly encourage you to take a look at them. I will try to keep the list updated as I discover more resources.

## Free Resources

So let’s look at some free resources:

- [Coursera machine learning course by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)

This course is a great introduction to the field of machine learning. Everything is explained simply and understandably. You also get your hands dirty by doing many different programming exercises in MATLAB/Octave. You can enroll for free, but you won't be able to share your certificate in the end (the content of the course is the same whether you decide to pay or not).
- [FastAI](https://www.fast.ai/)

This website contains 2 courses focused on deep learning, based on a book that is available for free on their GitHub repository. Each lesson has searchable transcripts, which means that if you search a word it will indicate to you when that word was pronounced during that lesson! It’s incredibly useful! For each chapter of the book, there are also questions to answer and task to complete. These are very useful to prevent passive learning, which is when you just listen to the lesson without getting your hands dirty. I started this blog because it is one of those tasks!! 
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) 

Kaggle is an amazing website for machine learning. It has everything you need to start applying your knowledge to real datasets. The site is divided into a course section where you can find many courses on different machine learning skills, a forum section where people share ideas and ask for suggestions, and a data section where you can find many datasets to freely use. However, the best part about Kaggle is definitely the compete section. Many machine learning competitions with prices are hosted and active every day. Just to give you an example, as I’m writing this article, there are more than 25 active competitions (even for beginners). It’s also possible to tackle closed competitions to see how you would have done on them. This is all really stimulating! (By the way, I came to know about Kaggle from FastAI, so I guess that’s another reason to follow their courses, they share a lot of useful information)  

## That's it
Machine learning may be discouraging at the beginning, but that's shouldn't prevent you from start your journey into this world. I hope that these resources will help you as they are helping me. If you know about useful free resources for beginners that you'd like to share, feel free to tell me. I will add them to the list.
Keep up the learning!
